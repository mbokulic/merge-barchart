# merge bar chart
A D3 bar chart where you can merge the individual bars into larger categories. 

[Link to the preview](https://rawgit.com/mbokulic/merge-barchart/master/index.html). 

The chart was **tested only on Chrome** at the moment!

The chart shows made-up bakery sales where it makes sense, e.g., to group all breads into one category.

## usage
To add a category to the merge queue click on the bar or the label. Write a label for the new category, then click the "merge" button to create a new category out of the highlighted ones. To un-merge, click on the category name below the merge button.

Click "sort" to sort the chart ascending or descending (it alternates).
